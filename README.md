# Discord Bot

## Simple Discord Bot for my personal server

### Commands
All commands can be found in the source code or through the *help* command which I will implement at some point.

#### Set Up
If you would like to use this bot make sure to 
1. Install ```requirements.txt```
2. Set up a .env with your own discord bot token (many tutorials online).
